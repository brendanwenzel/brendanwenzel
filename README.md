## Blockchain Developer

My coding journey started in Dec 2021 on a trip to Florida to visit my family. The previous 9 months, I'd spent more time than I proud of going down the blockchain rabbit holes. It was all fascinating.

Naturally, the first thing I had to do was lose a bunch of money trying to trade crypto. On that plane ride to Florida, the decision was made that if I'm going to take crypto/blockchain seriously, it was something that I needed to understand from a technilogical level to win. 

The first language to learn was JS because it seemed to be the mostly widely used among crypto projects. My first 2 months was mostly watching and rewatching multi-hour long tutorials. 

Using LibEVM's Subway repo, my first working and profitable on-chain trading bot was up and running by May 2022 after a month of altering it to work for my specific alpha. That bot went on to do about 80k transactions before other searchers found the alpha.

Solidity was the second language to get my focus. Obviously, if you want to work in blockchain, you have to know Solidity. 

Rust has become my latest focus to learn. While JS was good to learn concepts, it's too slow and uses too much memory for my purposes. 

I'm looking to work on Rust/Solidity related projects while contributing with JS, if needed.
