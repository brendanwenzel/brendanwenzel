My coding journey started in Dec 2021 on a trip to Florida to visit my family. 

On that plane ride to Florida, the decision was made that if I'm going to take crypto/blockchain seriously, it was something that I needed to understand from a tech level to win. 

## JS
The first language to learn was JS because it seemed to be the mostly widely used among crypto projects.

Using LibEVM's Subway repo, my first working and profitable on-chain trading bot was up and running by May 2022 after a month of altering it to work for my specific alpha. That bot went on to do about 80k transactions before other searchers found the alpha.

## Solidity
Solidity was the second language to get my focus. Obviously, if you want to work in blockchain, you have to know Solidity. 

Thanks to [Smart Contract Developer](https://www.youtube.com/@smartcontractprogrammer) and [Patrick Collins](https://www.youtube.com/@PatrickAlphaC) for all the work they've done to teach Solidity!

## Rust
With a firm grasp of Solidity, my attention is now on developing my skills with Rust!

My first project in Rust was building a [CLI for Perpetual Protocol](https://github.com/brendanwenzel/perp_cli_curie).
